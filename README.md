# databasecourse-app

A project I did for my Databases course. It's essentially an app to monitor/change/add orders to a supermarket chain. It's not perfect but has all the rough functionalities.
You can add/change/delete an order, add an item to an order and modify the items available/in stock/quantities/etc.
Firstly, I had to create a database from scratch and populate it with values for the cliesnts (supermarkets), suppliers, products, orders, product categories.
Then I started the Java app by linking the database to the project (to host the database locally) using Derby.
To run, link the database using Derby then run Welcome.java and a form pops up. You can navigate through orders and make the modifications or click to open the product form.
